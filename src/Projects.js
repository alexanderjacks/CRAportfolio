The <strong><em>API</em></strong> this app pulls from updates every 5 minutes. I built this <strong><em>React</em></strong> app for personal use, when I was hobby speculating in crypto markets in early 2018. As a quick way to slice through the hundreds of coin and altcoin markets, this app is surprisingly useful for a homemade project. I got completely carried away assigning <strong><em>CSS</em></strong> color branding per coin but oh well..."},
	{key: 2, favicon: "images/favicon2.png", screen: "images/screens/2a.png", name:'FWT Helper', techs:'Angular, Bootstrap, Bourbon, Pixlr', siteURL: 'https://fwt-helper.firebaseapp.com/', ghURL: 'https://github.com/Adjectival/fwt-helper', about: "A capstone project from code bootcamp, and a custom app built for my BFF who plays this mobile game Fantasy War Tactics that has a ton of characters. Before the game added its own feature to help sort the army of characters, I built this app in <strong><em>Angular.io</em></strong>. Animations are done using the awesome <strong><em>Saffron</em></strong> library, via <strong><em>Bourbon</em></strong>. The images are mostly from a wikia, but newer character images came from in-game screencaps which I then trimmed down in the (formerly awesome) web app <strong><em>Pixlr</em></strong>. Card colors reflect one of the character data attributes, as this was the first time I realized I could link <strong><em>CSS</em></strong> classes directly to the data layer. ^_^"},
	{key: 3, favicon: "images/favicon3.png", screen: "images/screens/3a.png", name:'Monster Party', techs:'Vue, SweetAlert, Coinhive', siteURL: 'http://monster-party.surge.sh', ghURL: 'https://github.com/alexanderjacks/monster-pets', about: "Halloween-themed Pok√©mon joke using <strong><em>SweetAlert</em></strong>, one of the coolest 3rd-party libraries out there: gaining so much control over pop-up windows is amazing. <strong><em>Vue.js</em></strong> is also amazingly fun to build with, as it demands less code and formatting than React. I added a widget from <strong><em>Coinhive</em></strong> that will mine crypto-currency in your browser instance while you're on this app-- I'm surprised how easy it is to accomplish browser mining, and plan to keep researching this new trend."},
	{key: 4, favicon: "images/favicon4.png", screen: "images/screens/4a.png", name:'Bridges of Portland', techs:'GatsbyJS, Gatsby starter, pics from my phone', siteURL: 'http://Pdx-Bridges.surge.sh', ghURL: 'https://github.com/alexanderjacks/lightbox-boiler', about: "Leveraged a <strong><em>GatsbyJS</em></strong> starter to show off my own photos of the charming bridges of my hometown. <strong><em>Gatsby</em></strong> is the best way I've found to build static <strong><em>React</em></strong> apps super-fast, and many starters provide more features than the beloved Create React App. Definitely will be learning more about <strong><em>Gatsby and GraphQL</em></strong> in the future."},
	{key: 5, favicon: "images/favicon5.png", screen: "images/screens/5a.png", name:'How To Crypto', techs:'Angular, MDBootsrap, FontAwesome', siteURL: 'https://how-to-crypto.herokuapp.com/', ghURL: 'https://github.com/Adjectival/how-to-crypto', about: "My first tutorial site, also an exploration of the impressive <strong><em>MDBootstrap</em></strong> library. I planned out the required steps to do stuff with crypto-currency, then used <strong><em>FontAwesome</em></strong> and screencaps to organize the information. Hosted on the free tier of <strong><em>Heroku</em></strong>, please forgive the slow load time."},
	{key: 6, favicon: "images/favicon6.png", screen: "images/screens/6a.png", name:'115th Congress', techs:'React, Python scripts, SVG', siteURL: 'https://us-congress.firebaseapp.com//', ghURL: 'https://github.com/alexanderjacks/congress_scraper', about: "Latest test of my <strong><em>web scraping</em></strong> abilities... I used a <strong><em>Python</em></strong> script to collate the data on all members of the current US Congress from .gov resources, then built this no-frills <strong><em>React</em></strong> app to list them out. Portraits are also from an official government site. <strong><em>SVG</em></strong> graphics were found as freeware and added. This definitely could use some more features, such as filters and a name or state search, but it works as a proof of concept for a custom dataset via <strong><em>Python web scraping</em></strong>."},
	{key: 7, favicon: "images/favicon7.png", screen: "images/screens/7a.png", name:'React Native Catalog', techs:'React Native, Sketch for wireframing', siteURL: 'https://github.com/Adjectival/RN-catalog', ghURL: 'https://github.com/Adjectival/RN-catalog', about: "Here's a nice example of some <strong><em>wireframing</em></strong>, from the days before I got into making PWAs (progressive web apps). This app was built from a tutorial to explore the versatile mobile development framework <strong><em>React Native</em></strong>. App wasn't ever deployed to App Store or Google Play, but that's the goal with <strong><em>React Native</em></strong>-- build it once, use it on all smart phones! Of course, PWAs are websites that can be downloaded to your Home Screen, so why worry about an app store anymore??"}
