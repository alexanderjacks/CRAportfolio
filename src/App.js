                  text="I built my first website in 1997, and figured out how to host it on the local ISP after I read enough BBS posts about FTP clients. I decided I wanted to do this professionally, so a few years later I enrolled in a Web Programming school in NYC and learned industry best-practices and even built my own GUI in Java! Then 9/11 went down, and I was traumatised and angry enough to join the US Air Force, where I began an intense 5-year career as a data and voice network sysadmin. Years later I used the 9/11 GI Bill to complete a Psychology degree, but I still missed working with technology and designing user experiences. So in 2017 I finished a code school in Portland, Oregon and learned how to work with current JS frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, (even Ember, in theory!) and how to leverage tools like Github, Bootstrap, Sass, FontAwesome, and more. I've been consulting as a web developer since 2015 (before code school, even) and am searching for a full time role in the Portland, Oregon area so I can supercharge my front-end learnings with some mentorship and Agile dev. Right now I'm volunteering with Code4PDX which is tuning me in to team development practices, and I'm also volunteering to build a site for Minority Veterans of America, which is helping me learn the Agile methodology and become comfy doing code reviews and PRs on Github. Thanks for reading all of this!"
